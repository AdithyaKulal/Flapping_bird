- Accent color: Orange-yellow (#FFB347) to emphasize game elements with a vivid, striking contrast.
- Body and headline font: 'Poppins', a geometric sans-serif known for its fashionable, avant-garde look.
- Use flat, vector-based icons for a clean, modern look. Simple icons will represent game actions and information.
- Design a fluid layout that adjusts game elements and UI components for various screen dimensions. Utilize CSS grid or flexbox to maintain proportional scaling.
- Implement smooth, physics-based animations for bird movement and obstacle transitions. Introduce subtle parallax scrolling effects for added depth in the background.
